\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Executive Summary
}
Summarize the objectives and key results of the deliverable.
PRACE deliverables document the work performed according to the Description of Action (Annex I to the Grant Agreement). All deliverables follow a consistent structure and layout. This prototype document describes in detail the conventions that the authors should adhere to. It is written as if it were a real deliverable. Delete the text in this deliverable bur retain the formatting.
The description of the work should be as concise as possible. It should also be explicit and state the results clearly.
